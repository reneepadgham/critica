	Critica respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), the text of which may be found on the U.S. Copyright Office website at	<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf">http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/pl105-304.pdf</a>, and other applicable laws, Critica has
	adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.
	Critica may also, at its sole discretion, limit access to Critica's website and services (collectively, "Service") and/or terminate the accounts of any
	users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. Critica will respond to claims of copyright
	infringement committed on the Critica website that are reported to Critica's Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample notice below.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	If you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and
	attorneys' fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the
	material or activity claimed to be infringing.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
	If you are a copyright owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of one, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report
	alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through the Services by completing the following DMCA Notice of Alleged Infringement and delivering it
	to Critica's Designated Copyright Agent. Upon receipt of the Notice as described below, Critica will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems
	appropriate, including removal of the challenged material from the Services.
